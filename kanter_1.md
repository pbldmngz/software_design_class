# SDLC
System Development Life Cycle is the name given to the group of phases (some required, other optional) during the development of a system, for example a piece of software. Those phases can be summarized in: Planification, analyzing system needs, designing the system, developing & documenting, testing, implementation & maintenance.
# # Roles acting in planning
This is the first and most important phase of system development life cycle. The *client* communicates his problem and requirements to the team, this information is used by *business analyst* and *project manager* in order to create a plan for the IS (Information System) department.
## Roles acting during analysis
In this phase special tools help the *analyst* make requirement determinations.One such tool is
the use of data flow diagrams. *Senior developers* and *architects* decide the methodology and start designing the fundamentals, we will refer to them as analysts. Once the recommendation is accepted the analyst can begin to make plans to acquire any hardware and system software necessary to create their system.
## Roles acting in design
Following the last phase, analysts start designing how the system will communicate with users. They also design the logic and the databases needed. In this phase *analyst* also works with *users* to design output that meets their informational needs.
## Roles acting in developing
*Developers (as needed: front-end, back-end, graphics, full-stack)* work along with the *analysts* and communicate what has to be done by different ways, for example structure charts or Nassi Scheiderman charts.
## Roles acting in documenting
This is the second part of developing, any work is done has to be documented. Also they have to create a user manual, frequently asked questions or any similar file. *Programmers* have an important role because they design, code and remove syntactical errors from computer programs.
## Roles acting in testing
So the system is build but is not ready for implementation. Before a company can run the
system, it must be tested. It is much less costly to catch problems before the system is already being used. A series of tests are made by *software testers*, first with random information and then with actual data.
## Roles acting in implementation
The software is distributed in different ways and users are trained on it by *vendors* or *system analysts*. Usually a company installs a new system at only one location or in one department. Once the system has passed testing in this department is installed in all departments.
## Roles acting in maintenance
Estimation said that maintenance is the most expensive part of SDLC. It is based on correcting errors, backing up data or supporting end users, so it takes the work of *all the team*.
